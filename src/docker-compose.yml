    # If a -service definition in your docker-compose.yml file uses the build attribute but does not specify an image attribute (i.e., it does not provide the name of an existing image from a registry), Docker Compose will not attempt to push the built image to a registry automatically.
    # Instead, Docker Compose will warn you about the missing image attribute. This warning serves as a reminder that the built image will not be pushed to a registry unless you explicitly specify where it should be pushed.
